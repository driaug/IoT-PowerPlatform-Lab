# Introduction
First of all, the Microsoft Technology Center team here at Brussels would like to once again give you a warm welcome to our MTC! We hope this hands-on lab will be just as inspiring as the other talks and demo's you have experienced with us

## What is the end goal of this hands-on lab
At the end of this hands-on lab you will have a simplified setup that is very similair to the engine demo we have already showed you. 

You will learn how to:
- Set up a new IoT Central application and add a new device to it
- Create valuable flows and experiences on top of the Microsoft Power Platform.
