# Setting Up IoT Central
Azure IoT Central is an Application Platform as a Service solution by Microsoft to simplify the development of IoT solutions. It relies on the classic Azure IoT Hub under the hood but takes away a lot of the pesky configuration none of us like.

## Setting up
- Navigate to the [Azure IoT Central Portal](https://apps.azureiotcentral.com/home) and go to the "Build" tab
- Create a new custom application and link it to the subscription we created earlier
- Once you are in your newly created IoT Central app, navigate to the devices menu and add a new device. A new device with the "registred" status will appear.
